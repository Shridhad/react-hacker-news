# Hacker News Client

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Problem Statement

The task is to write a small Hacker News Client. Weâ€™d like to see the following features in the client:

* User should be able to list best stories on Hacker News.
* User should be able to open the actual story.
* User should be able to read the comments related to individual stories.

## Prerequisites

* Node `v11`
* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Shridhad/react-hacker-news

$ cd react-hacker-news

$ yarn install
```

## Scripts

```
# Run dev server on port 3000
$ npm start


# Run tests
$ npm test
```


## APIs

This application uses [HNPWA API](https://github.com/tastejs/hacker-news-pwas/blob/master/docs/api.md) to fetch latest feed from hacker news.
